Ethius is the IGN of the guy that made the modifications to SalHack and created this thing. Also thanks to r333mo for making some combat features that I would've never thought of doing. 

## Salhack
Salhack is a Forge mod made by ionar. A few months ago, ionar has made the decision to leave the project, and therefore someone that wanted to buid the highway system on endcrystal.me decided to make this thing.

SalHackSkid is no longer maintained.
 
## Installation
SalHackSkid is a forge mod for `1.12.2` that was based off Salhack. We provide already pre build jar files on our [release page](https://github.com/pleasegivesource/SalHackSkid/releases). To use SalHackSkid just drop the jar file in your mods folder and start forge. Have fun!

**Tip:** You can open the GUI containing all "tweaks" with your left arrow at default (You can change that later.)

## Support

If you have a bug or want to suggest a feature raise an issue on Github.

## Info

Some of the code is pasted and proper credits are not given, but atleast it's open source now? :)

There is no git history because it contains personal info.
